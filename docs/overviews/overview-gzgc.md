This dataset contains images taken from a two-day photographic census of **Plains zebra** and **Masai giraffe** at **Nairobi National Park, Kenya** in 2015.   

It includes individual IDs for both species, with bounding boxes, metadata such as viewpoint, species, ID; and resized images (â‰¤3000 px).  

The IDs were assigned using the HotSpotter algorithm, [Crall et al. 2013](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6475023) by visually matching the stripes and spots as seen on the body of the animal.
