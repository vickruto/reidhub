# 🦓 Welcome to ReIDHub Docs

Welcome to the documentation for **ReIDHub** — a central hub for open-source animal re-identification (ReID) datasets, built on the **Access–Assess–Address** framework.

## 🌍 About ReIDHub

Animal re-identification is a critical task in wildlife monitoring and conservation, yet workflows for accessing, processing, and analyzing open-source datasets are often fragmented.  
**ReIDHub** addresses this challenge by providing a structured, extensible framework that makes dataset-driven research in animal ReID **portable, reproducible, and collaborative**.

The framework is built around three pillars:

1. **Access** — Retrieve open-source ReID datasets in standardized formats and explore them with tools like FiftyOne.  
2. **Assess** — Compute dataset statistics, detect potential image quality issues (e.g., overexposure, motion blur), and generate reusable artifacts such as embeddings and open-source model predictions — all with caching.  
3. **Address** — Tackle scientific and practical questions by benchmarking datasets with models like `MegaDescriptor`, or classical approaches such as `SIFT`.

Beyond datasets, ReIDHub also centralizes other **research outputs** related to the datasets  — including original citations, related publications, and enriched outputs — making it easier to build upon previous work.

## 📚 Supported Datasets

ReIDHub provides standardized access and enrichments for a growing catalogue of datasets, including:  

- [Great Zebra and Giraffe Count](datasets/gzgc.md)  
- Nyala Data *(upcoming)*  
- Lions Data *(upcoming)*  
- …and more  

Each dataset page includes high-level information, sample images, access instructions, standardized metadata, enrichments, usage notes, and citations.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Standardized Dataset Access** — work with diverse ReID datasets through a consistent interface.  
- **Dataset Mirroring** — redundancy via open repositories (e.g., Hugging Face, Kaggle).  
- **Data Enrichment** — reusable artifacts such as embeddings, bounding box predictions, and quality checks.
