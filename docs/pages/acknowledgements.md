## Acknowledgements

This project was built as a capstone for the Machine Learning Foundations Course (MLFC), a joint venture by MLAI and DSAIL.

Thanks to Neil, Radzim and Fred for their guidance through the course. 
Check out the course material and what I did. 

This project was greatly inspired by the pods (Python Open Data Science) project

I also learnt a lot from the Wildlife-Tools and Wildlife-Datasets projects while working on this project.
