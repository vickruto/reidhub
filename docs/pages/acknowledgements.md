This project was built as a capstone for the Machine Learning Foundations Course (MLFC) by [ML@CL](https://mlatcl.github.io/) @ [DSAIL](https://dekut-dsail.github.io/) in September 2025. 

Review the Course [Lecture material](https://mlatcl.github.io/mlfc/lectures/) and [Practicals](https://mlatcl.github.io/mlfc/practicals/)

Thanks to Neil, Radzim and Fred for their guidance through the course. 

This project was greatly inspired by the [pods](https://github.com/sods/ods/tree/main/pods) (Python Open Data Science) project by Neil & team.

I also learnt a lot from the [Wildlife-Tools](https://github.com/WildlifeDatasets/wildlife-tools) and [Wildlife-Datasets](https://github.com/WildlifeDatasets/wildlife-datasets) projects while working on this project.
