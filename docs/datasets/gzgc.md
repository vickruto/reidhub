## üìÑ Overview
This dataset contains images taken from a two-day photographic census of **Plains zebra** and **Masai giraffe** at **Nairobi National Park, Kenya** in 2015.   

It includes individual IDs for both species, with bounding boxes, metadata such as viewpoint, species, ID; and resized images (‚â§3000 px).  

The IDs were assigned using the HotSpotter algorithm, [Crall et al. 2013](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6475023) by visually matching the stripes and spots as seen on the body of the animal.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Notes


- Highly **imbalanced**: many individuals seen only once.  
- Metadata includes viewpoint; useful for studying orientation effects in ReID.  
- All images are in the `train` split; custom validation/test splits needed.

## üéØ Potential Usecases

- **Re-ID / Retrieval** under class imbalance  
- **Few-shot learning**: many IDs with 1 image only  
- **Viewpoint analysis** for stripes and spot patterns  
- Combine with other zebra/giraffe datasets for **cross-dataset generalization**
